# MockLLM
Project Overview

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using OpenAI's fine-tuned model to provide medical patients with accurate and context-aware responses. The system leverages patient data and hospital information to answer inquiries about health status, hospital locations, and other relevant details. Additionally, APIs are created to facilitate querying the model, trigger fine-tuning, and manage contextual memory.

## Features

    ## Fine-Tuned OpenAI Model

        The model is fine-tuned using anonymized medical patient data and hospital details.

        Context-aware interactions allow the system to remember and build upon prior conversations.

    ## Patient Inquiry Handling

        Patients can ask about their health status, treatment plans, and other personal medical details.

        Provides hospital-related information such as location, services, and operational details.

    ## APIs for Enhanced Functionality

        - Query API: Allows users to interact with the model by asking questions.

        - Training API: Triggers the fine-tuning process with updated data.

        - Context Memory API: Ensures the model retains and manages conversational context.

        - Data Retrieval System:  Integrates with a retrieval mechanism to fetch up-to-date information on hospitals and patient data as needed.

## System Architecture

The project consists of the following components:

    ### 1. Fine-Tuned Model

        Developed using OpenAI's GPT framework.

        Trained with specialized datasets containing patient and hospital information.

    ### 2. Backend

        Built with Flask to handle API requests and integrate the model with the data retrieval system.

        Implements authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure sensitive patient data.

    ### 3. Data Storage

        MySQL Database for storing patient records and hospital information.

        Chroma Vector database for document embeddings to enhance retrieval efficiency.

    ## 4. Frontend

        used Gradio for a quick access to the chatbot for testing purposes but the chatbot was deployed to a mobile application that's part of a closed source project for now
